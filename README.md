# WannaPlugins
An assemble of Minecraft Plugins for 1.15.1.

This plugin adds many commands to improve the gaming experience for administrators and users alike.
Continue these features:

  WannaAd is a command that allows you to send a warning to the whole server, very invasive. Useful if you need to notify of an event, an important event.
  
  WannaFly is a very simple command that allows those who have permission to fly.
  
  WannaBeGod is a command that allows you to become invincible in survival. If combined with the vanish it is perfect for finding some marauders trying to hack!
  
  WannaVanish is a command that allows you to become invisible to all players.
  
  WannaFreeze is a command that allows you to obscure a player's view, stop him permanently until the command is re-run, so even if the sly man leaves the server, it will be impossible for him to escape, and will remain forever immobile.
  
  ChatCraft is instead a command that allows players to chat with each other privately. A future update will allow you to have a chat log!
  
The plugin is also full of listeners, it modifies the player's death, entry and exit message, making it simpler and less invasive.

It also contains an EasterEgg, that of Herobrine: it will make people frighten, if done at the right time!
